The 17 Sustainable Development Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).

The [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:

  * end poverty
  
  * protect the planet
  
  * improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere
